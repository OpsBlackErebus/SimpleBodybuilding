## About

#### What?

SimpleBodybuilding is a food and exercise tracker.

#### Who? 

Simplebodybuilding is for anyone; however, bodybuilders and those who count macronutrients will benefit the most.

#### Why?

Simplebodybuilding is my passion project. It is both an answer to my frustration with current fitness apps and a way to showcase my skills as a developer.

#### How?

Simplebodybuilding is made with React / custom CSS on the front end and Node (express) / MongoDB on the back end.
